With versiom 18.3.0 upstream decides to "Deprecate the ability
to use an arbitrary Git installation in favor of bundled Git"
(see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/6725).

I therefore decided to remove the gitaly_git use flag (was
active on default) and only support the bundled Git from now on.

Note, though, that this first of all applies to the Gitaly part
of GitLab (that, as I understand it, will now always use the
bundled Git) and you could still change the 'bin_path' setting
in /etc/gitlab/gitlab.yml to use /usr/bin/git of the Gentoo Git
package for the other parts of GitLab instead.
But upstream recommends:
  You should use the Git version provided by Gitaly that:
  - Is always at the version required by GitLab.
  - May contain custom patches required for proper operation.
