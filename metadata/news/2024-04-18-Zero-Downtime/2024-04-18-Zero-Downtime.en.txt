The www-apps/gitlab ebuild still uses the (nearly) zero downtime upgrade
method as it was described in the upstream documentation until version
14.9.5
(https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/blob/v14.9.5/doc/update/zero_downtime.md#single-node-deployment).

In commit
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commit/22c17b6c766e1c93898b448983649fa7f9159b79
these instructions were removed with the comment:
  With only Puma carried in GitLab 14.0 onwards
  there is no possibility of minimizing any downtime
  in single-node upgrades.

  When the migration is run while leaving
  the previous version's puma running, the
  database changes are picked up in Rails
  dynamically and UI errors begin to be
  thrown to users.

  Given the disruption of features is essentially
  the same to users as a downtime when it
  affects critical features such as merge requests
  the section is false in indicating that
  downtime is minimized.

  Additionally this section is often discovered
  by users and blindly followed even for
  multiple version jumps that leads to
  broken upgrades.

So if the mentioned UI errors aren't acceptable you should stop
GitLab before Upgrading.
