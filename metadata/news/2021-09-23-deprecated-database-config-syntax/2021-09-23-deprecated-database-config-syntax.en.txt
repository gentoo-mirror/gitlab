Upstream switches to a new syntax for 'config/database.yml'. Starting with the current
14.3.0 version on can use the new syntax and with version 15.0 the support for the old
syntax will be removed.

So don't miss the new syntax when running 'etc-update' respectively 'dispatch-conf'.
If you stay with the old syntax you'll get a WARNING.
