The gitlab-gitaly package is now slotted as the gitlabhq itself.

On slot changing upgrades of gitlaghq one now can run the old
gitlabhq-<previuos slot>-gitaly.service (1) and do the

  bundle exec rake gitlab:backup:create RAILS_ENV=production

backup (as recommended before upgrading gitlabhq) just before
the "emerge --config" of gitlabhq. Without a slotted gitaly
the "emerge -u gitlabhq" had at this point already merged the
new gitaly version which sometimes failed to run the backup
command.

---
(1) As the gitaly service file is installed by the gitlabhq ebuild
    there already were two service files on slot changing upgrades:
      gitlabhq-<previuos slot>-gitaly.service
      gitlabhq-<new slot>-gitaly.service
    but both would run the same, the new version of gitaly.
