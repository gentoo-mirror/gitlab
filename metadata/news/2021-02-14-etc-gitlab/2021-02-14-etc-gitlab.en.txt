The first variants of the www-apps/gitlab-13.8.[34] ebuilds missed
the promised feature to install only the "standard" configs into
/etc/gitlab and also created needless ._cfg_0000_* files in the
/opt/gitlab/gitlab/config directory. This is fixed now but I didn't
create new -r1 revisions of the ebuilds as this would trigger a
rebuild for those who already installed www-apps/gitlab-13.8.[34]
but that rebuild wouldn't change the situation in /etc/gitlab.

Although the extra files in /etc/gitlab and /opt/gitlab/gitlab/config
don't hamper the functioning of GitLab you should repair this by
- Removing the needless /opt/gitlab/gitlab/config/._cfg_0000_* files.
- Create a new /etc/gitlab folder containing only the configs you
  changed. For example you could do:
    mv /etc/gitlab /etc/gitlab.old
    mkdir /etc/gitlab
    cp -a /etc/gitlab.old/database.yml /etc/gitlab/
    cp -a /etc/gitlab.old/gitlab.yml /etc/gitlab/
    cp -a /etc/gitlab.old/puma.rb /etc/gitlab/
  or if you still use unicorn
    cp -a /etc/gitlab.old/unicorn.rb /etc/gitlab/
  and only if you changed resque.yml from the default
    cp -a /etc/gitlab.old/resque.yml /etc/gitlab/
  and any other config file you changed.
