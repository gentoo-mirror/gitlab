In November 2021 when introducing some "New systemd and init.d files" I made
a typo in the new files/gitlab-sidekiq.service.2 file

Restart=on-failure

causing the Sidekiq Killer not to work any more: The Killer still stops
Sidekiq when it exceeds the memory limit but the systemd service will not
restart Sidekiq afterwards because it stops 'gracefully' with exit code 0
which is no failure. So I just changed files/gitlab-sidekiq.service.2 to

Restart=on-success

but didn't make a new release to avoid forcing everyone to rebuild just for
this 'minor' change. New builds will use this new setup but you may just edit
/lib/systemd/system/gitlab-sidekiq.service and change the 'Restart=' line.


Note that the Sidekiq MemoryKiller is not available for the OpenRC init script.


The Sidekiq MemoryKiller is configured by some environment variables. The
minimal config is added to /lib/systemd/system/gitlab-sidekiq.service by

Environment=SIDEKIQ_MEMORY_KILLER_MAX_RSS=2000000

You may override this and/or set some of the other variables (see
/opt/gitlab/gitlab/doc/administration/operations/sidekiq_memory_killer.md)
by creating /etc/systemd/system/gitlab-sidekiq.service.d/killer.conf with

[Service]
Environment=SIDEKIQ_MEMORY_KILLER_MAX_RSS=1000000
Environment=SIDEKIQ_MEMORY_KILLER_<some-other-variable>=<value>
