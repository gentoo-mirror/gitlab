NOTE! The upgrade to www-apps/gitlab-15.10.0 needs some preparation and
precautions as it depends on ruby-3.0.x and the switch from ruby27 to
ruby30 has to be done in the correct order.

So, here is how I did the upgrade on my GitLab Host:

1. Prepare for ruby30
---------------------
Change the RUBY_TARGETS variable in /etc/portage/make.conf to:

    RUBY_TARGETS="ruby27 ruby30"

We have to keep ruby27 here as long as the old GitLab server (in my case
gitlabhq-15.9.3) is running. Then run

    emerge -DuN1 dev-lang/ruby:3.0
    eselect ruby set ruby30

2. Update gitlab
----------------
Do
    emerge -DuN gitlab
    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemctl restart gitlab.target
    emerge --config "=www-apps/gitlab-15.10.0"

3. Cleanup
----------
If you like you could now in /etc/portage/make.conf change to

    RUBY_TARGETS="ruby30"

rebuild the affected packages and then remove ruby27.
