Upstream removed several deprecated features in the upcoming annual majors
release 14.0.0.

It is strongly advised to work through the upstream website about
"information about deprecations and removals for self-managed instances" at
https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/05/22/gitlab-13-12-released/#release-deprecations
before upgrading to version 14!

It should be especially pointed out at
- As announced in GitLab 13.0 legacy storage is deprecated and will be removed
  in GitLab 14.0.
  >>>>>> Before upgrading to GitLab 14.0 you   <<<<<<
  >>>>>> must migrate fully to hashed storage. <<<<<<
- NFS for Git repository storage deprecated
- Starting in GitLab 14.0, expired SSH keys added to GitLab will be disabled
  by default.
- The Git default branch name changes from 'master' to 'main'. This will not
  affect existing projects.
- PostgreSQL 12 will be the minimum required version in GitLab 14.0.
- Redis 4 has reached end of life and will no longer be supported.
- Removal of deprecated pipeline processing code:
  If you plan to upgrade from GitLab 13.2 or older directly to 14.0, you should
  not have any pipelines running when you upgrade, as they might report the
  wrong pipeline status when the upgrade completes. We recommend shutting down
  GitLab and waiting for all pipelines on runners to complete, then upgrading
  GitLab to 14.0. Alternatively, you can upgrade GitLab to a version between
  13.3 and 13.12 first, then upgrade to 14.0.
- Ruby version changing in Ruby.gitlab-ci.yml:
  (Note: This concerns the Ruby CI template _NOT_ the Ruby version used in the
         GitLab Code!)
  Currently, by default, the Ruby.gitlab-ci.yml file includes Ruby 2.5.
  To better support the latest versions of Ruby, the template is being changed
  to use ruby:latest which is currently 3.0.
- Support for Unicorn is deprecated and will be removed in GitLab 14.0 in favor
  of Puma.
- Update CI/CD templates to stop using hardcoded 'master':
  In 14.0, they will all be changed to use a variable that points to your
  projectâ€™s configured default branch instead.
