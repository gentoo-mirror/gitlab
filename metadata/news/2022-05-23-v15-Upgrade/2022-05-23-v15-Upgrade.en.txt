With version 15.0.0 the support for the lagacy database config was removed
(see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338182).

If you have not done so already you now have to migrate /etc/gitlab/database.yml
to the new syntax.

Previously, the config/database.yml file looked like the following:

production:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  database: gitlabhq_production
  ...

Starting with GitLab 15.0, it needs to define a main database first:

production:
  main:
    adapter: postgresql
    encoding: unicode
    database: gitlabhq_production
    ...
