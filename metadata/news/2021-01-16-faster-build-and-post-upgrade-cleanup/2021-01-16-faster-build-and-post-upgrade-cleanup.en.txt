Due to a dirty hack (1) the build time for gitlabhq and gitlab-gitaly could
be halved for upgrades/rebuilds of an existing installation.

If you already used this overlay before version 13.7.x there may be some
leftover files/directories on your GitLab host because of the major
modifications of the ebuilds starting with version 13.6.2 in December 2020.
On my GitLab host I found and removed e.g.:
  /var/lib/gitlab/.bundle/
  /var/lib/gitlab/.cache/
  /var/lib/gitlab/.config/
  /var/lib/gitlab/.node-gyp/
  /var/lib/gitlab/.yarn/
  /var/lib/gitlab/.yarnrc
  /var/log/githooks/
Also old gilabhq base dirs and old log dirs:
  /opt/gitlab/gitlabhq-<old-versions>
  /var/log/gitlabhq-<old-versions>

The eselect modules for gitlabhq and gitlab-gitaly give a hint now to clean
up the old version when you switch to a new slot.

---
(1) Instead of always starting from scratch the ebuild now copies
    - /opt/gitlab/gitlabhq/vendor/bundle
    - /opt/gitlab/gitlabhq/node_modules
    - /opt/gitlab/gitlabhq/public/asset
    to its build folder, so that the "bundle install", "yarn:install"
    and "gitlab:assets:compile" only have to install/build what changed
    compared to the installed GitLab version.
    Second the yarn cache at /usr/local/share/.cache/yarn/ is not cleared
    anymore saving about two minutes on my machine when yarn checks and
    downloads the needed dependencies.
