With version 13.8.3 the gitlab overlay got a grand refactoring:
- www-apps/gitlabhq was renamed to www-apps/gitlab
- Since gitlab and gitlay must have necessarily the same version,
  they were be merged together in the new www-apps/gitlab package.
- Due to the refactoring slots are no longer required. That means no
  eselect and no version number in the paths anymore.
- The configs are now installed to /etc/gitlab/ and from then on are
  managed the standard gentoo way. (1)
- By means of "Post Deployment Migrations" as described in
  <gitlab-base-dir>/doc/development/post_deployment_migrations.md
  upgrading will take place without downtime. (2)
- The ebuild will check if one is on a supported "Upgrade path"
  (see <gitlab-base-dir>/doc/update/README.md) to ensure that the
  requirements for "Upgrading without downtime" are met.

Before you emerge the new www-apps/gitlab some preparations are needed:
1. Adopt your portage package.use and package.accept_keywords files to
   the new package name without the 'hq'.
2. Stop your running gitlabhq instance.
3. Remove the eselect symlinks:
    eselect gitlab-gitaly unset
    eselect gitlabhq unset
4. Now run
     emerge www-apps/gitlab
   which updates dev-vcs/gitlab-shell-13.15.0 to revision r1 (with the
   new 'hq'-less paths) and installs the new www-apps/gitlab package
   (which includes gitlab-gitaly now).
   This will copy your current /opt/gitlab/gitlabhq-13.8.2/config to
   /etc/gitlab and update the version specific paths in database.yml,
   gitlab.yml, resque.yml, secrets.yml, puma.rb (resp. unicorn.rb) and
   initializers/smtp_settings.rb (if you use it). If you changed more
   than these "standard" configs add them to /etc/gitlab, too.
5. Run etc-update or dispatch-conf if required. If you changed/added
   anything in/to /etc/gitlab then run
    rsync -aHAX /etc/gitlab/ /opt/gitlab/gitlab/config/
   to sync the changes back to /opt/gitlab/gitlab/config/.
   NOTE: The trailing slashes are important in this rsync command!
6. Adopt your nginx site config to the new /opt/gitlab/gitlab/ path
   and restart nginx.
7. To complete the gitlabhq -> gitlab migration run
    emerge --config "=www-apps/gitlab-13.8.3"

With the www-apps/gitlabhq -> www-apps/gitlab migration finished
the following packages become obsolete:
  app-eselect/eselect-gitlab-gitaly
  app-eselect/eselect-gitlabhq
  dev-vcs/gitlab-gitaly
  www-apps/gitlabhq
After unmerging these clean up the leftovers:
  /opt/gitlab/gitlabhq-13.8.2/
  /var/tmp/gitlabhq-13.8.2/
  /var/log/gitlabhq-13.8.2/

Do you have a backup service or init script?
Don't forget to adopt it to the new paths, then!

---
(1) Nearly: Because gitlab expects the parent directory of the config
    files to be its base directory, a tool will be added to sync changes
    made in /etc/gitlab/ into /opt/gitlab/gitlab/config/. Maybe this
    will be done automatically on service (re)start.
(2) Nearly: The still required restart needs some time (about 90 secs on
    my machine e.g.). Also for this gitlabhq -> gitlab migration you
    have to stop gitlab during "emerge --config" for the last time.
