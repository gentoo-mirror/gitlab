Since March 2022 there is a dev-util/gitlab-runner ebuild in the gentoo tree
accompanied by acct-group/gitlab-runner and acct-user/gitlab-runner making the
package dev-util/gitlab-runner-bin of this overlay kind of obsolete and making
acct-user/gitlab-runner of this overlay really obsolete.

So
- acct-user/gitlab-runner of this overlay was removed
- a blocking deoendency was added to all dev-util/gitlab-runner-bin ebuilds
  to prohibit a parallel installation with dev-util/gitlab-runner

Although dev-util/gitlab-runner compiles in just a few minutes I'll keep the
dev-util/gitlab-runner-bin package in the overlay.

For those who want to switch to dev-util/gitlab-runner here how I did it:
  $ emerge gitlab-runner
This told me
  "dev-util/gitlab-runner" is soft blocking dev-util/gitlab-runner-bin-15.4.0
so I did a backup of /etc/gitlab-runner/config.toml (just to be sure; shouldn't
be neccessary), unmerged dev-util/gitlab-runner-bin and installed the new package:
  $ emerge -C gitlab-runner-bin
  $ emerge gitlab-runner
On my machine acct-user/gitlab-runner-0 from the overlay was already replaced by
acct-user/gitlab-runner-1 from the portage tree but the gitlab-runner user still
had the UID 125 (from the overlay) instead of the UID 510 (as the portage tree
package would use it). So I did:
  $ systemctl stop gitlab-runner.service
  $ usermod -u 510 gitlab-runner
That already changed ownership in /var/lib/gitlab-runner which is the HOME of
the gitlab-runner user.
  $ chown gitlab-runner:gitlab-runner /etc/gitlab-runner/config.toml
  $ chown gitlab-runner:gitlab-runner /var/log/gitlab-runner/
As I'm using systemd there were no files in /var/log/gitlab-runner/. If you use
the init.d Script you may have to chown the log files therein too.
Restart the service:
  $ systemctl start gitlab-runner.service
