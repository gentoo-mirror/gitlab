Upstream recommends to use the Git provided by Gitaly
(cited from /opt/gitlab/gitlab/doc/install/installation.md)
  From GitLab 13.6, we recommend you use the [Git version provided by
  Gitaly](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/2729)
  that:

  - Is always at the version required by GitLab.
  - May contain custom patches required for proper operation.

Currently GitLab requires Git version >= 2.31.0 but the stable version
in the portage tree still is dev-vcs/git-2.26.3.

The www-apps/gitlab ebuild has the "gitaly_git" USE flag to select
which Git to use. Up to now this USE flag is off by default and
/usr/bin/git from dev-vcs/git is used.

With the next updates this will be changed to "on by default", i.e.
the Git provided by Gitaly will be installed into
  /opt/gitlab/gitlab-gitaly/bin/
and the ebuild will write out a "Note" about the config changes
needed to use this Git with GitLab. 

You may then remove the package.accept_keywords and package.use
settings required by GitLab and downgrade dev-vcs/git to the stable
version 2.26.3.
