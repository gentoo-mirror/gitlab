Already in GitLab 16.0, upstream made the decision to remove support
for non-expiring access tokens.

What is the impact?

If you have automation that relies on a personal, group, or project
access token, and you don't modify its expiration date, it will stop
working whenever it hits the expiration date. If you previously did
not set an expiration date for your tokens, they are now set for no
earlier than May 14, 2024. Unless you extend the token lifetime and/or
rotate the token, your automation will stop working on that day.
