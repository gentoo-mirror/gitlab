So the dirty hack (1) turned out to break the build if a system library
used by some gem was updated since last installation of www-apps/gitlabhq.

One will get a @preserved-rebuild warning but the rebuild will always
copy the version linked to the old library from the current installation
and so bundler would simply "use" this instead of rebuilding.

To still enjoy the reduced build time when possible the new USE flag

  speedup_hack

was introduced which is on by default. To switch it off for one emerge
only simply do

  USE="-speedup_hack" emerge gitlabhq
