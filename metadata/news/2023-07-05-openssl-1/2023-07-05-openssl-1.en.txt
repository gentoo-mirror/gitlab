Today Gentoo masked openssl-1 and asked to upgrade to >= OpenSSL 3
immediately. But until GitLab finshes the migration to Ruby 3.1 (see
https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10034) we have to stick
with openssl-1 (see also the former news items 2023-07-05-openssl-3
and 2023-08-21-Ruby30-masking).

So we have to unmask openssl-1 again by adding

    =dev-libs/openssl-1.1.1u

to /etc/portage/package.unmask/gitlab
