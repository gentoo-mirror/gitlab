Because of the increasing problems caused by the removal of Ruby30 from the
portage tree I will not wait until upstream switches to Ruby31 in Q32024
(see https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10034) and already switch
to Ruby31 with the upcomming versions 16.2.8, 16.3.5 and 16.4.1 in the next
update of the gitlab overlay (see also the discussion in Issue
https://gitlab.awesome-it.de/overlays/gitlab/-/issues/155).

Unfortunately the migration will
- either require a considerable downtime (during switching your system to
  Ruby31 and afterwards building the new gitlab with it)
- or last quite some time (multiple rebuilds of gitlab needed in order 
  to minimize downtime) and be pretty complicated.
