As of GitLab 12.10, for source installations Sidekiq Cluster should be
used (see /opt/gitlab/gitlabhq-<SLOT>/doc/install/installation.md).

With version 13.7.1 this overlay finally follows here.

But note that the "bundle exec rake gitlab:check" function has a bug
(https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/295665) and finds fault
with more than one sidekiq process running. But with sidekiq cluster
this is normal and correct.
