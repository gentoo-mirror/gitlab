With the upcoming version 13.8.3 the gitlab overlay will get a grand
refactoring:
- www-apps/gitlabhq will be renamed to www-apps/gitlab
- Since gitlab and gitlay must have necessarily the same version,
  they will be merged together in the new www-apps/gitlab package.
- Due to the refactoring slots are no longer required. That means no
  eselect and no version number in the paths anymore.
- The configs will be installed in /etc/gitlab/ and from then on are
  managed the standard gentoo way. (1)
- By means of "Post Deployment Migrations" as described in
  <gilab-base-dir>/doc/development/post_deployment_migrations.md
  upgrading will take place without downtime. (2)
- The ebuild will check if one is on a supported "Upgrade path"
  (see <gilab-base-dir>/doc/update/README.md) to ensure that the
  requirements for "Upgrading without downtime" are met.

(1) Nearly: Because gitlab expects the parent directory of the config
    files to be its base directory, a tool will be added to sync changes
    made in /etc/gitlab/ into /opt/gitlab/gitlab/config/. Maybe this
    will be done automatically on service (re)start.
(2) Nearly: The still required restart needs some time (about 90 secs on
    my machine e.g.). Also for the gitlabhq -> gitlab migration you'll
    have to stop gitlab during "emerge --config" for the last time.
