Recent Gentoo update brought along the masking of Ruby 3.0:
- dev-lang/ruby-3.0.6-r3::gentoo (masked by: package.mask)
/usr/portage/profiles/package.mask:
# Hans de Graaff <graaff@gentoo.org> (2023-08-19)
# Ruby 3.0 is not compatible with OpenSSL 3 and consequently will be
# masked earlier than its upstream EOL date. Please use a newer Ruby
# version instead. Masked for removal on 2023-09-19.

Since GitLab still works on the migration to Ruby 3.1 (see
https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10034) we have to unmask
the latest Ruby 3.0 packageaby adding

    =dev-lang/ruby-3.0.6-r3

to /etc/portage/package.unmask or /etc/portage/package.unmask/<file>
and the ruby_targets_ruby30 USE flag of the bundler package by adding

    >=dev-ruby/bundler-2:2 -ruby_targets_ruby30

to /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask (note the '-' here; its a
kind of double negation).


GitLab now depends on =dev-ruby/rubygems-3.4* but since this version
is still ~amd64 in the tree and normally requires Ruby 3.2 we have to
add

    =dev-ruby/rubygems-3.4* ~amd64

to the accepted keywords and unmask the ruby_targets_ruby30 USE flag
by adding

    =dev-ruby/rubygems-3.4* -ruby_targets_ruby30

to /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask (note the '-' here; its a
kind of double negation).
