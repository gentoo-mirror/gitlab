In old intructions (here and on https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/GitLab)
you were told to add
  =dev-ruby/rubygems-3.1.4 ~amd64
and
  =dev-vcs/git-2.29.2 ~amd64
to a /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/... file but meanwhile these
exact versions aren't in the prtage tree any more and their follow ups
aren't installed because they are still unstable.

You should change these settings to
  =dev-ruby/rubygems-3.1* ~amd64
and
  =dev-vcs/git-2.29* ~amd64

Note that you also have to change
  =dev-vcs/git-2.29.2 -pcre-jit
in /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask to
=dev-vcs/git-2.29* -pcre-jit

After these changes do an
  emerge -u1a dev-vcs/git dev-ruby/rubygems
