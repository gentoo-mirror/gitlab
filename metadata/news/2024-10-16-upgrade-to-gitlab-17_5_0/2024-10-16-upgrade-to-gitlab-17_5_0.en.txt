With version 17.5.0 upstream switches from ruby31 to ruby32.
For a smooth transition do the following steps.

1. Prepare for ruby32
---------------------
Change the RUBY_TARGETS variable in /etc/portage/make.conf to:

    RUBY_TARGETS="ruby31 ruby32"

We have to keep ruby31 here as long as the old GitLab server is running.
Then run

    emerge -DuN1 dev-lang/ruby:3.2
    eselect ruby set ruby32

2. Update gitlab and gitlab-shell
---------------------------------
Do
    emerge -DuN1 gitlab gitlab-shell
    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemctl restart gitlab.target
    emerge --config "=www-apps/gitlab-17.5.0"

3. Cleanup
----------
If you like you could now in /etc/portage/make.conf change to

    RUBY_TARGETS="ruby32"

(as ruby32 is the default in current portage profiles you could
even remove the RUBY_TARGETS setting from /etc/portage/make.conf)
rebuild the affected packages and then remove ruby31.
