The Gitlab ebuild, including its dependencies, is no more maintained.
As a alternative, we recommend the official installation methods described
at gitlab.org. Unfortunately, there is no alternative at the moment. If you 
are interested in maintainership, please let us know by opening a new issue at 
https://gitlab.awesome-it.de/overlays/gitlab. We are willing to provide the
required infrastructure as needed.

Thanks for your understanding,
Daniel.
