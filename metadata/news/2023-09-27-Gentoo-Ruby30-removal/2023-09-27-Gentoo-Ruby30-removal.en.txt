Recent Gentoo update removed another bit of Ruby 3.0 support:
- virtual/rubygems lost ruby_targets_ruby30 USE flag
- dev-ruby/bundler lost ruby_targets_ruby30 USE flag
- ruby-ng.eclass added ruby30 to "removed implementations"
- ruby-utils.eclass lost ruby30 in RUBY_TARGETS_PREFERENCE
This causes
  masked by: invalid: DEPEND: expected: dependency string, got: ')',
  token 15, invalid: RDEPEND: expected: dependency string, got: ')', token 15)
errors for our gitlab ebuilds.

Since GitLab still works on the migration to Ruby 3.1 (see
https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10034) I had to add the
old versions of the ebuilds/eclasses to the gitlab overlay.

In addition you have to
a) unmask the ruby_targets_ruby30 USE flag for virtual/rubygems by adding

    =virtual/rubygems-17 -ruby_targets_ruby30

to /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask (note the '-' here; its a
kind of double negation).

b) set the ruby_targets_ruby30 USE flag for virtual/rubygems by adding

    virtual/rubygems ruby_targets_ruby30

to /etc/portage/package.use/<your file>
