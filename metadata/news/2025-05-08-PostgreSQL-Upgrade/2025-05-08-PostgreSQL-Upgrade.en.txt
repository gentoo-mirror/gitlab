One of the breaking changes with upcoming release 18.0 is: Postgres 14/15 deprecated
Since version 17.0 Postgres 16 is already supported but with version 18.0
failing to upgrade to Postgres 16 will break the deployment.

In the upcomming version 18.0 the PostgreSQL dependency wil be changed to
"dev-db/postgresql:16" so the emerge will pull in the new slot 16 of
dev-db/postgresql. If only the postgresql client is installed on the local host
(USE flag -server) the ebuild will do "eselect postgresql set 16" before
building GitLab (Note that you have to update postgresql on you database server
beforehand!). If the postgresql server is running on the local host the
ebuild will terminate and ask you to upgrade postgresql first.
