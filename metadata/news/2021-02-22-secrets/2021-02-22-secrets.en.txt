URGENT WARNING!

The www-apps/gitlabhq -> www-apps/gitlab migration missed to copy the
/opt/gitlab/gitlabhq/config/secrets.yml file. When the secrets.yml is
missing GitLab creates a new one but the new keys in this file can't
certainly decrypt the database record that were encrypted with the
old keys. That affects in particular the CI/CD settings and tokens.

If you have a backup of the old gitlabhq secrets.yml just restore it
and restart GitLab. Note that the backup created by
    bundle exec rake gitlab:backup:create RAILS_ENV=production
does not contain the secrets.yml file.

The 13.6.7, 13.7.7, 13.8.3, 13.8.4 and 13.9.0 ebuild were affected
but are fixed now.
