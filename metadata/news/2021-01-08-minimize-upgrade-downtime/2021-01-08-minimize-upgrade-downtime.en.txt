In order to minimize the downtime during upgrades the pkg_config() phase of
www-apps/gitlabhq was redesigned and all versions of www-apps/gitlabhq and
dev-vcs/gitlab-gitaly get a new slot now.

Being installed in a new slot the new versions of gitlabhq and gitlab-gitaly
will not interfere with the running GitLab instance during the "emerge" and
it allows to move the ruby compilations from the pkg_config() phase to the
pkg_install() phase.

So far, one had to stop the old GitLab instance, create a backup and then
call "emerge --config ..." which did the following steps:
  (1) Move the public uploads to the new slot.
  (2) Move the shared data to the new slot.
  (3) Migrate the configuration.
  (4) Migrate the database.
  (5) Install yarn and compile assets.
  (6) Compile GetText PO files.
Steps (5) and (6) together take about the same time as the "emerge".

In the new, revised ebuild steps (5) and (6) were moved to the pkg_install()
phase reducing the downtime significantly.
