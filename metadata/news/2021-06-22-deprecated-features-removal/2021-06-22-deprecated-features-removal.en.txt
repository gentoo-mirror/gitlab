Upstream removed several deprecated features in the upcoming annual major release
14.0.0.

It is strongly advised to work through the upstream website about
"information about deprecations and removals for self-managed instances" at
https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/06/04/gitlab-moving-to-14-breaking-changes/
before upgrading to version 14!
