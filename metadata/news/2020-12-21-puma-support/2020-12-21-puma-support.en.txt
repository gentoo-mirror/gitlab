With version 13.6.3 the ebuild supports the puma webserver (a unicorn
alternative). Switch the unicorn USE flag off and the puma USE flag on
if you want to use puma.

Note: Currently the default for the puma and unicorn USE flags is
          -puma +unicorn
      In the next 13.7 slot this will change to
          +puma -unicorn
