From GitLab 15.9, `database.yml` with only a section: `main:` is deprecated.

In GitLab 15.10 and later, you should have two sections in your `database.yml`,
`main:` and `ci:`. The `ci:` connection must be to the same database.

In GitLab 17.0 and later, you must have the two `main:` and `ci:` sections in
your `database.yml`.
