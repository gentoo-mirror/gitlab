From GitLab 15.9, `database.yml` with only a section: `main:` is deprecated.

In GitLab 15.10 and later, you should have two sections in your `database.yml`,
`main:` and `ci:`. The `ci:` connection must be to the same database.

In GitLab 17.0 and later, you must have the two `main:` and `ci:` sections in
your `database.yml`.

NOTE: On my test installation the upgrade and database.yml change worked
      flawlessly just with the usual restart of gitlab but it's recommended
      to do it the safe way this time, since a misconfiguration in the
      database.yml file may irreversibly damage the database:
      1. Stop gitlab
      2. Backup the database, e. g. by
           bundle exec rake gitlab:backup:create RAILS_ENV=production
         or just run your normal database backup timer/cron-job.
      3. emerge -u gitlab
      4. Update /etc/gitlab/database.yml
         Just uncomment the `ci:` section and set `database:`, `username:`,
         `password:`, `host:` to the _same_ values as in your `main:` section.
      5. Start gitlab and then do the
         emerge --config "=www-apps/gitlab-15.9.0"
