One of the breaking changes with upcoming release 17.0 is: Postgres 13 deprecated
Since version 16.2.0 Postgres 14 is already supported but with version 17.0
failing to upgrade to Postgres 14 will break the deployment.

In today's versions 16.9.6, 16.10.4, 16.11.1 the PostgreSQL dependency was
changed to "dev-db/postgresql:14" so the emerge will pull in the new slot 14 of
dev-db/postgresql. After installing the new GitLab version you should upgrade
your PostgreSQL server:
1. Stop GitLab
2. Upgrade your PostgreSQL server to version 14
   (see https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/PostgreSQL/QuickStart#Migrating_PostgreSQL)
   Don't forget "eselect postgresql set 14"!
3. Start GitLab
