NOTE! The upgrade to www-apps/gitlabhq-13.6.1 and its dependencies needs
some preparation and precautions as it requires ruby-2.7 and git-2.29,
two packages that - at this writung - are still masked by keyword. Also
some USE flags we will need are still masked in the base respectively
the hardened profile. Finally bundler-2 is used now.

So, here is how I did the upgrade on my GitLab Host:

1. Prepare for ruby27
---------------------
Change the RUBY_TARGETS variabel in /etc/portage/make.conf to:

    RUBY_TARGETS="ruby26 ruby27"

We have to keep ruby26 here as long as the old GitLab server (in my case
gitlabhq-13.5.3) is running. Now repeated execution of

    emerge -p1 dev-lang/ruby:2.7

will tell you about all the unsatisfied USE flag constraints.
I collected them in /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/ruby27:

    =dev-lang/ruby-2.7.2 ~amd64
    =app-eselect/eselect-ruby-20191222 ~amd64
    =dev-ruby/minitest-5.13.0 ~amd64
    =dev-ruby/net-telnet-0.2.0 ~amd64
    =dev-ruby/power_assert-1.1.7 ~amd64
    =dev-ruby/rake-13.0.1 ~amd64
    =dev-ruby/xmlrpc-0.3.0 ~amd64
    =dev-ruby/did_you_mean-1.4.0 ~amd64
    =dev-ruby/rdoc-6.2.0 ~amd64
    =dev-ruby/kpeg-1.1.0-r1 ~amd64
    =virtual/rubygems-16 ~amd64
    =dev-ruby/rubygems-3.1.2 ~amd64

YMMV. A special case is the bundler-2 where we have to unmask
the ruby_targets_ruby27 USE flag by adding

    =dev-ruby/bundler-2.1.4 -ruby_targets_ruby27

to /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask (note the '-' here; its a
kind of double negation).

When all constraints are met run

    emerge -1 dev-lang/ruby:2.7


2. Prepare for git-2.29
-----------------------
Here you have two alternatives now.
A. Update the Gentoo git to version >=2.29
   Unmask it by adding

       =dev-vcs/git-2.29.2 ~amd64

   to e.g. the /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/gitlabhq file.
   Here we have to unmask the pcre-jit USE flag. Like above add

       =dev-vcs/git-2.29.2 -pcre-jit

   to the /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask file.
B. Use the git version gitlab-gitaly comes with
   Activate the gitaly_git USE flag for gitlabhq and gitlab-gitaly
   and rebuild both packages. For gitlabhq the USE flag only
   changes the git dependency. The gitlab-gitaly git will be
   installed to /var/lib/gitlab-gitaly/[bin|libexec|share].


3. Update @world
----------------
Switch the ruby profile

    eselect ruby set ruby27

and then update @world as usual. This will install git-2.29.2 and
gitlabhq-13.6.1 with its dependencies. I recommend to do a backup
of your GitLab Repos etc. now. I simply do

    su - git
    cd /opt/gitlabhq/
    bundle exec rake gitlab:backup:create RAILS_ENV=production

Then stop the current gitlab and do the

    emerge --config "=www-apps/gitlabhq-13.6.1"

and switch to the new gitlab by

    eselect gitlabhq gitlabhq-13.6


4. Cleanup
----------
If you like you could now in /etc/portage/make.conf change to

    RUBY_TARGETS="ruby27"

rebuild the affected packages and then remove ruby26.
