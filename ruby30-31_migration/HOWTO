Migrating www-apps/gitlab from Ruby30 to Ruby31
===============================================

You have two options:
A) Shut down the GitLab Server during migration.
   This is simpler and faster than option B) with the drawback
   of a considerable downtime.
B) Do the migration with minimal downtime of the GitLab Server
   (as usual just the time required for restarts) with the
   drawback that you have to emerge www-apps/gitlab two times.
   Also this option is quite complicated.

The instructions below assume that you do the Ryby30 to Ruby31
switch with the upgrade from gitlab-16.4.0 to gitlab-16.4.1
(the ebuilds for 16.2.7 to 16.2.8 and 16.3.4 to 16.3.5 are also
prepared for the Ryby30 to Ruby31 switch). And they use my paths
for overlays and files under /etc/portage/. YMMV
The paths are:
- Gitlab overlay: /usr/local/overlay/gitlab/
- Local x-host overlay: /usr/local/portage/host/
- GitLab related files under /etc/portage/:
  /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask
  /etc/portage/package.use/gitlab
  /etc/portage/package.mask/gitlab
  /etc/portage/package.unmask/gitlab

When I started the migration RUBY_TARGETS in /etc/portage/make.conf
was set to "ruby30" and the /etc/portage/ files above contained the
following items.
cat /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask
>=dev-ruby/bundler-2:2 -ruby_targets_ruby30
=dev-ruby/rubygems-3.4* -ruby_targets_ruby30
=virtual/rubygems-17 -ruby_targets_ruby30

cat /etc/portage/package.use/gitlab
www-apps/gitlab postgres
acct-user/git gitlab
virtual/rubygems ruby_targets_ruby30

cat /etc/portage/package.mask/gitlab
>=dev-libs/openssl-3
>dev-ruby/rubygems-3.4.15

cat /etc/portage/package.unmask/gitlab
=dev-lang/ruby-3.0.6-r3
=dev-libs/openssl-1.1.1u

  
Instructions for option A
-------------------------
A.0) Prerequisites
Stop the GitLab Server:
  systemctl stop gitlab.target

Edit /etc/portage/make.conf to
  RUBY_TARGETS="ruby31"

Remove from /etc/portage/package.use/gitlab the line
  virtual/rubygems ruby_targets_ruby30

Remove from /etc/portage/package.mask/gitlab the line
  >=dev-libs/openssl-3

Remove from /etc/portage/package.unmask/gitlab the lines
  =dev-lang/ruby-3.0.6-r3
  =dev-libs/openssl-1.1.1u
(the file should be empty then, so remove it completely).

Remove from /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask the lines
  >=dev-ruby/bundler-2:2 -ruby_targets_ruby30
  =dev-ruby/rubygems-3.4* -ruby_targets_ruby30
  =virtual/rubygems-17 -ruby_targets_ruby30
(the file should be empty then, so remove it completely).

A.1) Upgrade to Ruby31
Do an update world but exclude gitlab and gitlab-shell yet:
  emerge -DuNa world --exclude "gitlab gitlab-shell"
(You'll get a warning that the installed www-apps/gitlab-16.4.0
package is "masked by: invalid: DEPEND: ...". You can ignore it.)
This will install dev-lang/ruby-3.1.x in a new slot and upgrade
openssl to version 3.0. Also the dev-ruby/* packages wil be rebuild
for the new RUBY_TARGETS="ruby31" but without ruby30.
You'll get a "existing preserved libs" warning for the openssl-1.1
libs still used by the installed www-apps/gitlab-16.4.0 but there is
no need for an "emerge @preserved-rebuild" now as you'll update to
www-apps/gitlab-16.4.1 in the next step.
After the upgrade of openssl you should reboot now.
  shutdown -r now
Note that gitlab-puma.service and gitlab-sidekiq.service won't work
now, so stop gitlab.target completely again:
  systemctl stop gitlab.target

Now switch to Ruby31 by
  eselect ruby set ruby31
and emerge the new gitlab packages by
  emerge -DuNa world
This will install the new version www-apps/gitlab-16.4.1.
You'll also get an "existing preserved libs" warning for ruby-3.0
still using the openssl-1.1 libs. This can be ignored as we will
remove ruby-3.0 soon.

When this is done restart GitLab and do the "emerge --config"
  systemctl daemon-reload
  systemctl start gitlab.target
  emerge --config "=www-apps/gitlab-16.4.1"

A.3) Remove Ruby30
  emerge -c
This will uninstall dev-lang/ruby-3.0.x and maybe some other now
unneeded dependencies.


Instructions for option B
-------------------------
B.0) Prerequisites
You'll need a local repo for some temporary ebuilds. I used this one:
  cat /etc/portage/repos.conf/host.conf 
  [x-host]
  location = /usr/local/portage/host
  masters = gentoo
  auto-sync = no
So create the /etc/portage/repos.conf/host.conf definition and copy
the x-host directory:
  cp -a /usr/local/overlay/gitlab/ruby30-31_migration/x-host \
  /usr/local/portage/host
Or, if you already have such a local repo, do
  cp -a /usr/local/overlay/gitlab/ruby30-31_migration/x-host/* \
  /usr/local/portage/host/

B.1) Install Ruby31 besides Ruby30
Edit /etc/portage/make.conf to
  RUBY_TARGETS="ruby30 ruby31"

Add to /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask the lines
  =virtual/ruby-ssl-12 -ruby_targets_ruby30
  dev-ruby/* -ruby_targets_ruby30

Add to /etc/portage/package.mask/gitlab the line
  >=dev-ruby/rexml-3.2.6

Temporarily replace two eclasses with their old 'ruby30' versions:
  cd /usr/portage/eclass/
  mv ruby-ng.eclass ruby-utils.eclass /root/
  cp /usr/local/overlay/gitlab/ruby30-31_migration/eclass/* .

Do an update world but exclude gitlab and gitlab-shell yet:
  emerge -DuNa world --exclude "gitlab gitlab-shell"
This will install dev-lang/ruby-3.1.x in a new slot and adds the
ruby31 RUBY_TARGET to the dev-ruby/* packages.

B.2) Build GitLab with Ruby31
Now switch to Ruby31 by
  eselect ruby set ruby31
and emerge the new gitlab packages by
  emerge -DuNa world
(You'll get a warning that the installed www-apps/gitlab-16.4.0
package is "masked by: invalid: DEPEND: ...". You can ignore it.)
This will install the new version www-apps/gitlab-16.4.1.

When this is done restart GitLab and do the "emerge --config"
  systemctl daemon-reload
  systemctl start gitlab.target
  emerge --config "=www-apps/gitlab-16.4.1"

B.3) Remove Ruby30 and upgrade to openssl-3
Edit /etc/portage/make.conf to
  RUBY_TARGETS="ruby31"

Remove from /etc/portage/package.use/gitlab the lines
  virtual/rubygems ruby_targets_ruby30

Remove from /etc/portage/package.mask/gitlab the lines
  >=dev-libs/openssl-3
  >=dev-ruby/rexml-3.2.6

Remove from /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask the lines
  >=dev-ruby/bundler-2:2 -ruby_targets_ruby30
  =dev-ruby/rubygems-3.4* -ruby_targets_ruby30
  =virtual/rubygems-17 -ruby_targets_ruby30
  =virtual/ruby-ssl-12 -ruby_targets_ruby30
  dev-ruby/* -ruby_targets_ruby30
(the file should be empty then, so remove it completely).

Rebuild the system with RUBY_TARGETS="ruby31" by
  emerge -DuNa world
The dev-ruby/* packages will be rebuild for the new RUBY_TARGETS
setting and openssl will be upgraded to version 3.0.
You'll get an "existing preserved libs" warning for www-apps/gitlab
still using the openssl-1.1 libs.
The upgrade of openssl requires a reboot:
  shutdown -r now

Uninstall dev-lang/ruby-3.0.x and maybe some other now
unneeded dependencies by
  emerge -c

Now do rebuild www-apps/gitlab with openssl-3 libs:
  emerge -1a @preserved-rebuild
When this is done restart GitLab
  systemctl daemon-reload
  systemctl restart gitlab.target

B4) Cleanup:
Move back the original eclasses
  cd /root
  mv ruby-ng.eclass ruby-utils.eclass /usr/portage/eclass/

Remove the package folders added to /usr/local/portage/host/ or the
whole /usr/local/portage/host with it's repos.conf file respectively.

Remove from /etc/portage/package.unmask/gitlab the lines
  =dev-lang/ruby-3.0.6-r3
  =dev-libs/openssl-1.1.1u
(the file should be empty then, so remove it completely).

Check if there are still packages installed from the x-host
(or the name your local repo has):
  eix --only-names --installed-from-overlay x-host
For me these were listed:
  dev-ruby/bundler 
  dev-ruby/rubygems
  virtual/ruby-ssl
  virtual/rubygems
Rebuild these packages but now from the gentoo repo:
  emerge -1a bundler dev-ruby/rubygems ruby-ssl virtual/rubygems
